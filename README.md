# Manjaro Setup

Uses:
- dotbot
- i3-gaps
- polybar
- dunst
- urxvt
- nvim
- feh
- wal
- oomox
- xrandr

To install the dotfiles just backup your original config files and run `cd dotfiles && ./install`

Note that the current theme uses:
- ultra flat icons orange
- hacked-aio

To keep the dotfiles minimal, these files are kept separately.
You can get them from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16kIgC7qdQILu6Lw5n0Buyg2p8CGUQ9CX) and unarchive them in `~/.icons`
